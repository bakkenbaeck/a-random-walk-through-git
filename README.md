# A Random Walk Through Git
https://github.com/bakkenbaeck/a-random-walk-through-git

_A weird tour through Git and some of its internals._

Just run the `DEMO.sh` script.
Give step number as parameter to fast forward to that step: `./DEMO.sh 52`

Or see its output at https://bakkenbaeck.github.io/a-random-walk-through-git

So much documentation!
